	 * faults		int				Contains number of page faults
	 * array		int[]			Array of frames where values will be added
	 * i			int				Loop iteration variable
	 * pointer		int				Pointer to index where value will be input in array
	 * tok			StringTokenizer	Tokenizer that separates reference string element by element
	 * value		int				Element in the reference string to be added to array
